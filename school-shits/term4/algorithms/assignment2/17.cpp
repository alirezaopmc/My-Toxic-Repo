Algorithm 1.7 (nth Fibonacci Term, Iterative) is clearly
linear in n, but is it a linear-time algorithm?
In Section 1.3.1 we defined the input size as the size
of the input. In the case of the nth Fibonacci term,
n is the input, and the number of bits it takes to
encode n could be used as the input size. Using this
measure the size of 64 is lg 64 = 6, and the size of
1024 is lg 1024 = 10. Show that Algorithm 1.7 is
exponential-time in terms of its input size. Show further
that any algorithm for computing the nth Fibonacci term
must be an exponential-time algorithm because the size
of the output is exponential in the input size. See
Section 9.2 for a related discussion of the input size.
