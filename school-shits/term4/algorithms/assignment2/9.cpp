Suppose you have a computer that requires 1 minute
to solve problem instances of size n = 1000. What
instance size can be run in 1 minute if you buy a
new computer that runs 1000 times faster than the
older one, assuming the following time complexities
T(n) for our algorithm?
(a) T(n) = Theta(n)
(b) T(n) = Theta(n^3)
(c) T(n) = Theta(10^n)
