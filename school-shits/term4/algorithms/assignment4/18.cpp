Using Induction

Base:
    n = 2
    A * B
    => ( A * B ). 1 Paranthes. Ok

Hypothesis:
    n = k. Ok

Then:
    n = k + 1
    we must start paranethesing from two matrices
    after doing that we can merge them instantly
    then we have k matrices and it's ok by the
    induction hypothesis. Ok
