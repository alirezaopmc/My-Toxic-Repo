ARR.
If we use array we can easily use binary search method because we have
    references to all elements. But we must shift them and it takes a long time.
Insert = BinarySearch + Shifting
Time Complexity of ARR
    = O(lgN) + O(N) = O(N)

If we use linked list we can get rid of shifting because we just need to
    change references to next and prev, but we can not use binary search method.
Insert = FindFromHead + Assign
    = O(N) + O(1) = O(N)

And for hash table we can not even sort them in any basic methods. Because hash-
    -table use its own function to manage the elements and it doesn't depend on comparison.
NO NO NO !
